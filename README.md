## Summary

This project explores a dataset of 1,157 baseball players having attributes : handedness, batting average, home runs, height(inches) and weight (pounds)
Main focus of this project is to explore how the handedness of a baseball player affects their performance in relation to the other available attributes like batting average and homeruns hit.

## Design

* I choose pie chart to show the count of handedness  to show good visulization and easy  to differentiate between overall count.
* I looked at how Weight and Height affect overall performance of player by showing a trend line(if i see a trend) and color measure.
* I created a dashboard which can compare between multiple players and show whether they are star players or have potential.
* I also created a  height/weight distribution for comparision.
